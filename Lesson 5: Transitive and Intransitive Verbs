Lesson 5: Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

In Japanese, sometimes there are two types of the same verb, transitive and intransitive. 
There are several ways to identify which is which. 
Intransitive:
- A verb that is completed without an acting agent direct object. 
- An object that is acting upon itself.
Transitive:
- A verb that is completed by an acting agent or a direct object. 
- An object that is acting upon something else. 

Example:
"The ball dropped" (intransitive) and "I dropped the ball" (transitive)

Sometimes, the English translation changes depending on the verb.

Example:
箱に入れる - "To put it in the box" (Transitive)
箱に入る - "To enter the box" (Intransitive)

In Japanese, transitive and intransitive verbs have the same meaning, except one indicates that someone had a direct hand in the action. You can find the direct object by asking the "what" question with the verb. 

Example:
"Sam kicked the ball". The direct object can be found by asking "what did Sam kick? The ball" - Transitive
"Sam slept". There is no direct object, which is found by asking "what did Sam sleep?" - Intransitive
"Sam worked". The question "What did Sam work?" is an awkward sentence. This is intransitive since "worked" isn't a verb that can do itself to something else.

Notice:
You can always check which form the verb takes on Jisho!

Particles:
Since intransitive verbs cannot have a direct object because there is no direct acting agent, を should be replaced with が or は.

Notice: 
There are verbs in English that are both transitive and intransitive. A good example is "Open". In Japanese, the verbs take a different form.
Example: 
A door being opened by me (Intransitive)
A door opening by itself (Transitive)
開ける - To open (Transitive)
開く - To open (Intransitive)
