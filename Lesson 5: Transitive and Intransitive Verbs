Lesson 5: Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

In Japanese, sometimes there are two types of the same verb, transitive and intransitive. 
The difference between the two is that one verb is an action done by an acting agent / direct object (transitive), and the other is a verb that is completed without a direct object (intransitive). The big part to understand is that a direct object is whatever the verb of the sentence is acting upon, it's doing something to something else. Therefore, an object acting upon itself is an intransitive verb. 

Example:
"The ball dropped" (intransitive) and "I dropped the ball" (transitive)

Sometimes, the English translation changes depending on the verb.

Example:
箱に入れる - "To put it in the box" (Transitive)
箱に入る - "To enter the box" (Intransitive)

In Japanese, transitive and intransitive verbs have the same meaning, except one indicates that someone had a direct hand in the action. You can find the direct object by asking the "what" question with the verb. 

Example:
"Sam kicked the ball". The direct object can be found by asking "what did Sam kick? The ball" - Transitive
"Sam slept". There is no direct object, which is found by asking "what did Sam sleep?" - Intransitive
"Sam worked". The question "What did Sam work?" is an awkward sentence. This is intransitive since "worked" isn't a verb that can do itself to something else.

Notice:
You can always check which form the verb takes on Jisho!

Particles:
Since intransitive verbs cannot have a direct object because there is no direct acting agent, を should be replaced with が or は.

Notice: 
There are verbs in English that are both transitive and intransitive. A good example is "Open". In Japanese, the verbs take a different form.
Example: 
A door being opened by me (Intransitive)
A door opening by itself (Transitive)
開ける - To open (Transitive)
開く - To open (Intransitive)
