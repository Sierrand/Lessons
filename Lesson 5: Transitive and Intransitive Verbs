Lesson 5: Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

In Japanese, sometimes there are two types of the same verb, transitive and intransitive. 
The difference between the two is that one verb is an action done by an acting agent (transitive), and the other is a verb that is completed without a direct agent (intransitive). 
Example:
"The ball dropped" (intransitive) and "I dropped the ball" (transitive)
Sometimes, the English translation changes depending on the verb.
Example:
箱に入れる - "To put it in the box" (Transitive)
箱に入る - "To enter the box" (Intransitive)
In Japanese, transitive and intransitive verbs have the same meaning, except one indicates that someone had a direct hand in the action. 
Notice:
You can always check which form the verb takes on Jisho!

Particles:
Since intransitive verbs cannot have a direct object because there is no direct acting agent, を should be replaced with が or は.
