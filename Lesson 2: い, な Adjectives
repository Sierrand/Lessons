Lesson 2: い, な Adjectives

There are two types of adjectives in Japanese. These are identified by their last syllable. Like verbs, these conjugate for tense (present and past) and polarity (affirmative and negative).
There are two ways to use adjectives, before です and before a noun. They conjugate different depending on where they land in the sentence.
