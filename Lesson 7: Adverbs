Lesson 7: Adverbs

Adverbs are words that add further description to verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. 
Examples:
Quickly(Adverb) Ran(Verb)
Very(Adverb) Big(Adjective)
Quite(Adverb) Strangely(Adverb)

Frequency Adverbs:
いつも - Always
まいにち - Everyday
よく - Often
たまに - Occasionally
ときどき - Sometimes
ぜんぜん (Must be a negative sentence) - Never
あまり (Must be a negative sentence) - Not often / Not much
まいしゅう - Every week
まいつき - Every month
まいとし - Every year

In Japanese, you can convert adjectives to adverbs by doing two things:
い Adjective: Stem+い
い Adverb: Stem+く
な Adjective: Stem+な
な Adverb: Stem+に

The following are adverbs that do not have an adjective partner:
ちょっと - A bit
すこし - A little
とても - Very
かなり - Quite
もっと - More
もうちょっと - A bit more
もうすこし - A little more
ゆっくり - Slowly

Modifying Adjectives:
Adverbs appear immediately before the adjective. This is generally the same as English. In front of adjectives, adverbs are limited to descriptions of degree or magnitude. 

Modifying Verbs:
The adverb can appear anywhere between the topic+は and the verb. Keeping in mind that the word order defines the enphasis of the sentence. If you are unsure about the emphasis, the adverb should be placed before the verb. 
Notice:
Although です is actually a verb, you cannot modify です with an adverb since it is describing a state rather than an action. 

Modifying adverbs:
Multiple descriptive adverbs can be used together, but these affect the verb independantly. Again, the adverb is placed immediately before the adverb it is modifying.
Example: 
かのじょ は しずか に とても おもしろい ほん を よみました。
Kanjo ha shizuka ni totemo omoshiroi hon wo yomimashita
"She quietly read a very interesting book."
