Lesson 4: は, が, を Particles

か
It is very easy to form questions in Japanese. All thats needed is to add か to the end of the sentence. 

は 
This is used to indicate the subject of the sentence. Notice that sentences without subjects are very common in Japanese, and that Japanese speakers actually tend to omit subjects when they think it's clear. 

の
This is a particles that connects two nouns. The second noun provides the main idea, and the first one makes it more specific. It also acts like the posessive (x's) in English. Although the order can be changed, Japanese seems to be more consistent when arranged with the main idea at the end and the description placed before it. 

も
This is a particle that indicates that an item, too, has a shared property. In english, the word "too" can be placed after the sentence, as a whole, but not in Japanese. In Japanese, も can only go where は is in the sentence. 

ね
Sentences often end with the tags ね when the speaker is seeking the listener's confirmation or agreement. It is equivalent to the "right?" used at the end of an English sentence.

よ
Is added to a sentence if the speaker wants to assure the listener of what has been said. When よ is added, a statement becomes an authoritative degree.
