Lesson 6: Pointing Words

When we don't know the names of things, we use pointing words. In Japanese, the pointing words depend on the proximity to the speaker and the listener. 

Set 1)
これ - This thing (close to the speaker)
それ - That thing (close to the listener)
あれ - That thing over there (not close the speaker nor the listener)
どれ - Which 

Set 2)
この＋Noun - This noun (close to the speaker)
その＋Noun - That noun (close to the listener)
あの＋Noun - That noun over there (not close the speaker nor the listener)
どの＋Noun - Which noun

Set 3)
ここ - Here (close to the speaker)
そこ - There (close to the listener)
あそこ - Over there (not close the speaker nor the listener)
どこ - Where 

Set 4)
だれ - Who
だれの+Noun - Whose noun

Set 5)
The words for "something" and "anything" depend on if the sentence itself is positive or negative. 
なに - What
なにか (positive statement) - Something
なにか (Question) - Anything?
なにも (Negative statement) - Not anything 
Notice:
なにか and なにも are used in place of the particles は, が, and を.

Notice:
Question words like どれ, どの and なに cannot be followed by the particle は. Instead,　が must be used.
